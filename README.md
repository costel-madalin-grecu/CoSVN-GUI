# CoSVN-GUI
	DESCRIPTION

	Graphical User Interface for source control repositories, (for now just SVN is supported, but the idea is to go further and support also Git).
The project uses QT for graphical user interface and subversion tool for accessing repository.


	THE STORY OF THE PROJECT

	I created this project because I wasn't able to find a tool to satisfy my needs. In my daily activity, I do allot of code-review, watch history, 
show differences and none of tools I found for Ubuntu 15 was good enough for me. So I decided to create my own tool. And, after few sleepless nights I 
created ... something. Is not perfect, is  not complete, but it works and satisfied my needs. So I decided to share it. 


	HOW TO BUILD

	For building it you should:
	- configure (during this you should install dependecies: QT)
        - cd build
	- make 

	Or simply open the qt creator project file in QtCreator.

	For now, you should clone the repository from command line. The application doesn't support (yet) clonning project and authentication. 

	Enjoy!
